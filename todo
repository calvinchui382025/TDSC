Calvin-
Thanks for sending this.
You’re talented sir!... I particularly like that Dan Wesson feature!
Before we get too far down the road, please advise your rate or otherwise how you believe you’d charge us for a web-site overhaul.
I then have to sell our Founder, Greg Baker on the overhaul and estimated expense.
At that time, we’ll be happy to pull together an outline of content.
I’m thinking real simple at first… as briefly discussed,
· A video that loops on the home page showing one of our members running a rifle/ pistol combination drill
· Maybe some tabs at the top
o who we are
o what we do
o proficiency requirements
o gear requirements
Thanks for giving this some thought and look forward to hearing from you and hopefully see you on the range.
Best,
-Gregg Wingert
